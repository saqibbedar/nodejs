What are modules? Module refers to the reusable piece of code that can be imported. 

Node modules? These are specific to the NodeJs application, there can be three types of Node modules.

1. Core Modules: These modules are built-in that come along with nodejs i.e. fs, http, etc.
2. Third-party modules: These are external libraries installed via npm i.e. express etc.
3. Custom Modules: These are same as JavaScripts modules, where we separate our code in different files and import them.
